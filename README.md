## Hi, I'm Saveliy 👋

## What I'm Into
Development: Writing maintainable code with solid architecture. I care about understanding the reasoning behind technical decisions and implementing best practices.

Beyond Code: Passionate about online privacy and security - staying informed about digital privacy practices and keeping my online presence secure. Also exploring cryptocurrency and the stock market, fascinated by how technology intersects with finance.

Learning: Always digging into the "why" behind things, not just the "how."
